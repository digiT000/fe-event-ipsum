# Tech Surge

## Description

This project aims to solve the problem of fragmented tech event information.  Currently, finding and booking tech-related events can be a tedious process, requiring users to search across multiple platforms.  This website provides a centralized hub where users can easily discover and book tech events in one convenient location.  You can view the live website here: [https://event-ipsum.vercel.app/](https://event-ipsum.vercel.app/)

Tech enthusiasts often struggle to find relevant events.  Information is scattered across various websites, social media groups, and newsletters, making it difficult to keep track of upcoming opportunities.  Existing event platforms may not cater specifically to the tech community or offer a streamlined booking experience.

**Task:**  My task was to design and develop a comprehensive event website from start to finish, addressing the challenges faced by tech event seekers. This involved handling everything from initial design concepts to the final implementation and deployment of the website. The goal was to create a user-friendly platform that simplifies the process of discovering and booking tech events.

**Action:**  I built the "Tech Surge" using a modern and robust tech stack:

*   **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS were used to create a performant, type-safe, and visually appealing user interface.  Next.js provided server-side rendering and static site generation for improved SEO and performance.  TypeScript ensured code quality and maintainability, while Tailwind CSS facilitated rapid and responsive styling.
*   **Backend:** Node.js and Express.js formed the foundation of the server-side logic, handling API requests and database interactions.
*   **Database:** Prisma ORM was employed to interact with the database efficiently and securely. Prisma simplified database operations and provided type safety for data access.
*   **Image Management:** Cloudinary was integrated for seamless image uploads, storage, and optimization, ensuring fast loading times and efficient media handling.

This combination of technologies allowed me to create a full-stack application with a focus on performance, scalability, and maintainability.

**Result:**  The "Tech Event Hub" provides a user-friendly platform for discovering and booking tech events. Key features include:

*   **Centralized Event Listing:**  Users can browse a comprehensive list of tech events, filtered by category, date, location, and other criteria.
*   **Detailed Event Information:** Each event listing includes detailed information such as event description, speakers, agenda, location, date, time, and booking options.
*   **Easy Booking:**  Users can easily book tickets for events directly through the platform.
*   **Image Management:** High-quality images are used to showcase events, enhancing the user experience.
*   **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

The project successfully delivers a one-stop solution for tech event discovery and booking, simplifying the process for users and providing a valuable resource for the tech community.  The chosen tech stack proved effective in building a robust and scalable application.
